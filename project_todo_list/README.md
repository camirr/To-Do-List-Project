**Why to-do list?**

As a student, keeping a to-do list is important as it helps to organize tasks with a list that can make everything much
more manageable. However, I haven't found one that fits me perfectly yet. Thusï¼ŒI decided to design a personalized
to-do list application specifically for students.


## User Stories
