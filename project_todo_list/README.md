## To-Do List

***Purposes:***

- To see a clear outline of students' completed and uncompleted tasks


***Features:***
- Creates new tasks
- Different views showing items
- Searches


**Why to-do list?**

As a student, keeping a to-do list is important as it helps to organize tasks with a list that can make everything much
more manageable. However, I haven't found one that fits me perfectly yet. Thusï¼ŒI decided to design a personalized
to-do list application specifically for students.


## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add a task to my to-do list.
- As a user, I want to be able to view tasks in different views on my to-do list.
- As a user, I want to be able to mark a specific task as done when I finish it.
- As a user, I want to be able to search a to-do task by task title on my to-do list.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of tasks searched by due date on my to-do list. 
- As a user, I want to be able to see the number of all, incomplete or completed tasks on my to-do list.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my to-do list to file.
- As a user, I want to be able to load my to-do list from file and resume exactly where it left off.

## Phase 4: Task 3
- I will refactor the long method in ToDoListUI by identifying the tasks and subtasks that it performs and trying to 
  put the subtasks into a separate method.
- As ToDoList class performs too many functions, I will move some of them to new classes.
